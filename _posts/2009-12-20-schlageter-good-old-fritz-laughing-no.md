SCHLAGETER: Good old Fritz! (Laughing.) No paradise will entice you out of your barbed wire entanglement!

THIEMANN: That’s for damned sure! Barbed wire is barbed wire! I know what I’m up against…. No rose without a thorn!… And the last thing I’ll stand for is ideas to get the better of me! I know that rubbish from ‘18…, fraternity, equality, …, freedom…, beauty and dignity! You gotta use the right bait to hook 'em. And then, you’re right in the middle of a parley and they say: Hands up! You’re disarmed…, you republican voting swine! — No, let 'em keep their good distance with their whole ideological kettle of fish…. I shoot with live ammunition! _When I hear the word culture…, I release the safety on my Browning!_“

SCHLAGETER: What a thing to say!

THIEMANN: It hits the mark! You can be sure of that.

SCHLAGETER: You’ve got a hair trigger.
