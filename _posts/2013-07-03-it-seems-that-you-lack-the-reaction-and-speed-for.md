It seems that you lack  
The reaction and speed for rocking Starcraft  
With siege tanks, or perhaps colossi,  
And your skills of riding a bike will suck  
Because of that, and for you never rode offroad

You lack the sharp, cruel brain,  
Wired for rocking Group By, Reinterpret Cast, and sorting a million integers,  
Or perhaps you lack the degree?  
And you won’t work at Google,  
Because of that, and for you never really applied

And the charisma, that would  
Open those doors without you knocking,  
Without you begging,  
And she won’t turn her head  
Because of that, and perhaps you didn’t even care

But in that moment of you, the weak,  
The morbid, the useless, the pitiful, the gnaw on the bones –  
There is more of you than those who are better,  
And with your headcount  
You shall prevail.
