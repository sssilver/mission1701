Some days just remind you that most of the crap you waste your heart worrying about does not matter one bit.

On a fundamental level I am as joyful as a human can ever be every moment that Emma is alright. It’s my cheat-code for unlocking god mode in my game of life. I’m invulnerable, minus a single point of failure. All of my eggs are in one basket. It’s every bad system architecture and investment decision combined.

And it’s perfect.
