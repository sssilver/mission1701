Here there dwells an older us - a part of us that was there before we became apes. This is the wolf that we once were. This wolf understands that happiness cannot be found in calculation. It understands that no truly significant relationship can ever be based on a contract. First there is loyalty. And this we must respect through heavens fall. Calculation and contracts always come afterwards - as the simian part of our soul follows on from the lupine.
