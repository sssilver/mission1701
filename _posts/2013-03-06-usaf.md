When I was a little boy, I dreamed airplanes. Specifically, American military airplanes. They looked more beautiful to me than their counterparts, showed their intent more brazenly, appealed to my senses in mysterious ways. I found the Lockheed Martin F-22 to be the finest piece of machinery ever created by men. During chemistry lessons, I’d draw the USAF logo behind the pages of my textbooks. It seemed so extremely distant, so alien, and so extremely cool.

This month, I live in Texas with a retired US Air Force Master Sergeant. Together with his family, my lady and I are waiting for my baby girl to be born. Bob cooks steak. He talks about airplanes and drives us on his golf car in his field towards the sunset. When it’s cold, he gives me his jacket. It’s a flight jacket – it reads “Robert Gnade - USAF”.

I can’t explain what this does to me, the boy that dreams airplanes. — with Robert Gnade.
