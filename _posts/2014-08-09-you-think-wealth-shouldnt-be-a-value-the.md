“You think wealth shouldn’t be a value”, the sandman said. “But you’re wrong to attribute it to your own nobility. You just realize that you’re failing to obtain enough of it in the great race for success. But what does it matter what the currency is?

In that better world of yours, where everyone races for something different, how much of it would you have obtained? Where would you have stood? Roughly in the same spot, perhaps?

Does it matter what you’re running after, if you can only run so fast?”
