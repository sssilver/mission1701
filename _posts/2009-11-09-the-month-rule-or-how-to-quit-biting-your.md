Learning to quit biting your fingers or nails is _possible_. I did it.

I have been biting mine since I was 11. I was biting them violently, till blood, till there was simply nothing left to rip off neither with teeth nor with any other slicer. My fingers looked disgusting. I tried hiding them when talking to people that mattered and bit them even more violently when I had a stressful situation.

Sometimes, in the moments of strength and inspiration I wanted to try quitting my habit. Some of these times I actually tried. I failed miserably. No, biting fingers was not just about a habit. It felt damn good. It was not an unconscious self control issue. I realized I was addicted. This may sound weird to someone who doesn’t do it, but to a hooked person this does sound so painfully right! I did it because I loved doing it, and not because I didn’t realize.

I checked the Internet. Some sources said it was a syndrome of some sort. Some said it was the lack of vitamins. Some suggested it was psychological. None of these seemed really right.

Then once I had a moment of serious weakness. I bit my fingers so violently I thought I was going to cause a permanent serious damage to them. And I decided to quit. Just like that, without trying. And then it just occurred to me…

Starting something when you are weak, discouraged and lack every inspiration is so much stronger than starting it when you are ‘in a good shape’!! My plan was very simple: I wasn’t going to bite any of my fingers, not even once, not even if I wanted it to death (you’d be surprised to find out that not biting it doesn’t actually kill you!).
