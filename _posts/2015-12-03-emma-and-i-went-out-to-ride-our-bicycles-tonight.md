Emma and I went out to ride our bicycles tonight after the sun, and in that calm uneventful moment of her jumping on and off the sidewalks on her bike and me thinking that she’s pretty decent at it, I realized that this was the evening I’ve been living toward my entire life. It was the evening that validated every single choice I ever made. I thought of every circumstance in the universe across space and time that led to this point. Such a profound, miraculous thing to experience happiness this way, I wish it to all of you.
