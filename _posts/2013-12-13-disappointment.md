You’re cursed by all the things you never built, all the girls you never met, all the dreams you cheated on. You gave up amazing things for boring things, difficult things for easy things, sleepless nights for healthy sleep, video games for a weekly soccer match, motorcycles for cars, pain for apathy. You’re such a sad fucking idiot.

It’s revolting when you put on that Adidas jacket. You’re no better than them. And they’re no better than the worst of them. You all smell of the same material.
