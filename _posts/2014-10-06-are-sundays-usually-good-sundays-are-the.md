— Are sundays usually good?  
— Sundays are the worst. It’s a different crowd. Families going out on picnics with kids, turning their faces away like I don’t exist, feeling good to be in that nice car, you know what I’m sayin’? Me I don’t like the Sunday crowd. Like that hundred dollar bill in their pockets makes all their choices right. Like I chose not to have that bill. We don’t always choose what happens to us, you know what I’m sayin’? Think about it.  
— We never choose what happens to us  
— Wise words my man, but this be America. People here don’t give much shit, you know what I’m sayin’? We like to think we earned that hundred dollar bill cuz we be so extraordinary. Where’d you be from?  
— A place far away you’ve never heard of  
— What, like a different planet of sorts?  
— Yeah, a planet far from here, they call it Armenia  
— Gee man, when you’re around this bridge, wave to the old man sometime. I’m usually on this corner, or that corner over by that Interstate sign. Just holler – “Hey Sid, this be the guy from that far away planet!”, will be good to see you around  
— Yeah Sid, thanks for the conversation  
— Thank you my man, how do you say “thanks” in Armenian?  
— "Shnor-ha-ka-loo-tyoon"  
— Jesus fucking Christ, man…
