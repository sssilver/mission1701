After Lenovo refused to sell me a high-end laptop because I tried to pay with an Armenian MasterCard, I’ve switched to a Mac as my main development machine, and iPhone as my phone.

I’ve always thought Apple was overmarketed, but now I think they are undermarketed. I used to think of OSX as of a glamorous toy. Now I think of it as of a rock-solid UNIX operating system. And the hardware build quality is just astonishing. Basically, there is no other laptop in this world that is worth your money.

Drastically changing what I believe and feel is one of the most special pleasures in this life for me.
