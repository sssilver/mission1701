I think that’s when you fail. When you start trying to figure out what you’re the best at. That’s when you become delusional, coz you start to believe that. I’d rather just continue to ride that mule, than to bet on the cocky voice.

You see, people spin out of control like that all the time. Those are the most tragic stories, the most gifted people, who start to believe it’s really all them. It’s not all you. It can’t be all you. Just like you need air, to fly a kite… it’s not the kite. It’s the air.
