Lionel Messi made 16 million Euros to play in 2013 (before endorsements!) He has the best coaches, the best gear and the best fans in the world, He is incredibly impressive but not the type of player I like to cheer for (he has enough fans!).

For me the ultimate athlete is the no-name who is out practicing on the field after finishing her 9 hour shift at Subway restaurant. These are the type of people who inspire me. Their passion is true and unspoiled.
