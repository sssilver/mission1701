“All type of knowledge ultimately means self-knowledge.”

“You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”
