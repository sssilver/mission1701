Light me up a cigarette and put it in my mouth  
You’re the only one that wants me around  
And I can think of a thousand reasons why  
I don’t believe in you, I don’t believe in you and I

Light me up a cigarette and put it in my mouth  
You’re the only one that wants me to die  
And I can think of a thousand reasons why  
I don’t believe in you, I don’t believe in you

I’m not yours anymore  
I’m not yours anymore  
No, I’m not yours anymore  
I’m not yours anymore

Jump into your white mobile and run away  
You’re always leaving me behind  
And I can think of a thousand reasons why  
I don’t believe in you, I don’t believe in you and I

I’m not yours anymore  
I’m not yours anymore  
No, I, I’m not yours anymore  
I’m not yours anymore

Light me up a cigarette and put it in my mouth  
You;re the only one that wants me around  
And I can think of a thousand reasons why  
I don’t believe in you, I don’t believe in you and I
