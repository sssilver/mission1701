So I guess my thinking is that the big problems came when game developers lost control of their companies. The Broderbund guys were programmers and gamers and developers. Ken was. Quite a few of the other – Activision was founded by a game player, and Accolade. A lot of other companies were founded by guys who knew games and as long as they were in charge, it seemed like things were better. But when gradually their companies hired professional management – professional managers love spreadsheets and they loved evidence, because they didn’t have gut feelings that said, “Yeah, that’s a great idea! Yeah, that’ll sell! People will love that! Look at that!” Instead, they would say, “Well, what are the numbers here? How do we compare this? What are your comparables?”

That question, man, I think has been just a death knell for the industry because as soon as you start forcing games to have successful comparables, you’re guaranteeing that you’re not going to ever see anything fresh again.
