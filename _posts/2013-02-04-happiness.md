A clear horizon. Nothing to worry about on your plate. Only things that are creative, and not destructive, and that within yourself. Within me, I can’t bear quarreling, I can’t bear feelings between people. I think hatred is wasted energy. And it’s all not productive. I’m very sensitive. A sharp word, said by, say, a person who has a temper… if they’re close to me… hurts me for days. I know we’re only human, we do go in for these various emotions, I call them “negative emotions”. But when all these are removed, and you can look forward… And the road is clear ahead, and now you’re gonna create something.

And that’s as happy as I would ever want to be.
