Hey boy, Hey boy

Hey boy  
When we first met  
On the 31st  
And it was Halloween  
You know what I mean

And I was the one dressed up  
as a rocket  
that night  
Please, please  
Don’t ask me why

Hey boy, Hey boy

If you came over me  
And said: Tell me  
if you’re alone tonight  
can I be by your side?”  
Hey baby, ain’t we having fun Tonight  
Little rocket in the sky  
Little rocket in the sky  
Tell me

Was a rocket in the sky  
I’m a rocket in the sky

Baby baby  
Ain’t we having fun tonight  
I’ll be by your side  
I’ll be by your side

Baby baby  
I’ve been there all  
Year long  
Standing by the telephone  
The telephone

Hey baby  
If you care for me  
Why don’t you call  
And give me some dignity  
Some decency  
Rocket in disguise   
Rocket in disguise  
Don’t ask me why  
Don’t ask me why

I’m a rocket in disguise  
Don’t ask me why  
I’m a rocket in disguise  
Don’t ask me why

Tell me  
I’m a rocket in disguise   
Hey boy, Hey boy, Hey boy
