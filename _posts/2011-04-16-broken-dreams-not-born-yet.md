A great and inspiring documentary narrated by William Shatner.

Made me reflect on things.  It’s a little sad being a citizen of a country that really makes no difference at all. We won’t have a space shuttle program in my lifetime. We won’t build submarines, great operating systems, or great weaponry. Armenia won’t manufacture the next BMW or Boeing, it won’t build the next LHC, it won’t send the next man to Mars or open space. My kids won’t have opportunities to become pilots flying fifth generation fighter jets, they won’t serve in one of the strongest armies of the world, they will not build the next Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Sun, IBM, Apple, and they will not be enabled to think of ways to disrupt these businesses. Their thrill with groundbreaking researches in biotechnology, genetic engineering and artificial intelligence will be naive. The politicians they vote for will not have the freedom and the power to decide which country to attack in order to keep the oil prices down for them. I will dismiss my kids’ dreams of becoming an astronaut. Hell I will even dismiss my kids’ dreams of becoming a Formula 1 pilot. Their best shot will be aging in peace and dying in relative comfort. They will be able to choose one of the 3.7 available careers, and watch great foreign documentaries about powerful foreign nations’ extraordinary foreign achievements. Achievements that were never enabled for them.

I couldn’t care less about Narekatsi or Komitas at this point. I care about the power we don’t have, about the power we never really had. I care about this power I don’t believe we will ever have.
