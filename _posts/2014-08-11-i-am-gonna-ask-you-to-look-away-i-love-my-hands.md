I am gonna ask you to look away. I love my hands, but it hurts to pray. Life I have isn’t what I’ve seen… The sky is not blue, and the field isn’t green.

Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me, wait for me.  
Wait, wait for me. Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me, wait for me…

I’m gonna ask you to look away, a broken life will never stay. I tried too hard, and I always lack. Days are gray, and nights are black.
